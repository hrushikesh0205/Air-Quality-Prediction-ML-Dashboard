## 📄 Project Summary

The **Air Quality Prediction Dashboard** is an interactive web application built using **Machine Learning (Multiple Linear Regression)** and **Streamlit**.  
It predicts **PM2.5 Annual Average** concentration based on major pollutants — **SO₂**, **NO₂**, and **PM₁₀**, helping to analyze and understand air quality patterns across cities.

The system also integrates **Anomaly Detection** (using both **Z-Score** and **Isolation Forest**) to identify unusually high or low pollution levels.  
Users can explore pollutant relationships, visualize data through heatmaps and scatter plots, and predict future air quality trends in real time.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 PM2.5 Prediction
- Predicts PM2.5 concentration using **SO₂**, **NO₂**, and **PM₁₀** values.  
- Categorizes air quality as **Good**, **Moderate**, **Poor**, **Very Poor**, or **Severe**.  

### 🔹 Dataset Visualization
- Displays a clean, tabular preview of air quality datasets (2021–2023).  
- Provides **correlation heatmaps** to show relationships among pollutants.  
- Includes **interactive scatter plots** for visual comparison between pollutants and PM2.5.

### 🔹 Anomaly Detection
- **Z-Score Method:** Detects cities/towns with abnormally high or low PM2.5 values.  
- **Isolation Forest (ML-Based):** Identifies complex pollution outliers using machine learning.

### 🔹 Model Training & Evaluation
- Dataset merging, cleaning, and retraining scripts for maintaining data accuracy.  
- Achieved an **R² Score ≈ 0.80** and **MAE ≈ 0.91**, showing strong predictive performance.
